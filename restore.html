  <h2>How to restore your purchase of the paid app</h2>
  <hr/>
  <h4><strong>Option 1: Register through iCloud</strong></h4>
  <p>• Get a device on which you have downloaded the paid version of the app</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- If you have deleted the app off of the device, this option will not work</p>
  <p>• Register/signin with iCloud</p>
  <p>• Open Pookoo the Destroyer and navigate to the upgrade screen where you are asked to purchase all levels</p>
  <p>• Tap "Already purchased"</p>
  <p>• Your iCloud account should be registered with an indication that you have purchased the app, and the game should continue with the unlocked content</p>
  <br />
  <p>Once you have done this, any device on which you are signed in to iCloud should also be able to restore the purchase on the upgrade screen.</p>
  <p>If this will not work for you, consider Option 2 below.</p>
  <br />

  <h4><strong>Option 2: Refund, repurchase</strong></h4>
  <p>If the first option doesn't work for you, you may consider requesting a refund from Apple for your purchase of the original paid app, and then repurchase the in app purchase of all the levels. Though this is not the most convenient process, it will allow you to get back into the "official" Apple app store processing flow with your purchase registered to your Apple ID.
